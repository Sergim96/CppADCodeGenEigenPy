# CppADCodeGenEigenPy Simple Example

This is a basic example of CppADCodeGenEigenPy usage where we
auto-differentiate a weight sum-of-squares model with respect to the model
inputs. The model is defined in `model.cpp`.

## Usage

1. Compile and build the model by running `make`.
2. Try it out from a Python script: `python load_model.py`.
